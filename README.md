Provide below the new commands used to run the alternative tool and comment on your choice of options and how and if using this tool would affect the results.

#Generate the index files

sudo apt install bowtie2

cd ~/7BBG2016/data/reference

bowtie2-build -f hg19.fa hg19_index

#Replace the aligner with Bowtie2

bowtie2 -x hg19_index -1 ~/7BBG2016/data/trimmed_fastq/NGS0001_trimmed_R_1P -2 ~/7BBG2016/data/trimmed_fastq/NGS0001_trimmed_R_2P -S ~/7BBG2016/data/aligned_data/NGS0001.sam

Bowtie2 is more suitable for aligning short sequences, with a relatively high operating speed.

The results of aligning using BWA Mem may be more accurate.
